I have developed several games, but only two turned out perfectly. Both were the result of teamwork. My friend and colleague, Denis, and I collaborated to create:

1) "Black Hole" - A short story-driven 3D game with narration and player-choice dependency.
2) "Making the Leap" - A skydiving simulation featuring realistic graphics and physics.

Game Hosting:
Since the game files are too large for a GitHub repository, we uploaded them to a dedicated platform, Itch.io:

Development Process:
We used Unity as the game engine and C# as the primary programming language for both projects. Most of the assets were created by us using Blender for 3D modeling. Each project required approximately 2–3 months of work.

Achievements:
"Black Hole" won 1st place at the National IT Olympiad 2020.
Two years later, "Making the Leap" earned 5th place at the same competition. During its development, we formed a valuable partnership with Bulgaria’s top skydiving company, which provided insights into the physics of skydiving.
